This repostiory contains code to identify facial emotions with images. This is done through the use of convolutional neural networks. There are two main CNNs that are defined here in this project, InceptionV3 and ResNet50. Both CNNs have been pre-loaded with weights from the imagenet classfication task and transfer learning has been applied. With transfer learning, addional layers are applied to the base neural network and are spefically trained for a task. They have both been trained for the same task of facial emotion classification and the accuracy of both have been evaluated.
